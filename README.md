## Inspiration
A lot of times we buy items, put them away, and forget about them until after they expire. Our original idea was centered around makeup expiration (everyone who wears makeup has a liquid foundation past its prime!) but after talking with the Qualcomm Institute table, we were inspired to expand the use case of our app to expiration dates for other things, like groceries, to help older people in their daily lives. Since our team members have grandparents with Alzheimer's and dementia, we are hopeful that this app will be able to help similar seniors check food expiration dates, especially for pre-prepared meals with no expiration labels, and therefore avoid eating expired food.

## What it does
Our app allows you to input items in a grocery-style list with their expiration dates. Once they are expired, the items will be highlighted in red. When you have used up the item in real life, pressing and holding an item will remove it from the list. When new items are added they are automatically sorted into the list, so users will be able to see expired items first. Since our UI is designed to be easy to use and understand, we hope that seniors will be able to intuitively use the app without repeated instruction.
